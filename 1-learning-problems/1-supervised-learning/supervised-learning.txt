Supervised learning describes a class of problems that involves using a
model to learn a mapping between input examples and the target variable.

Models are fit on training data comprised of inputs and outputs and used
to make predictions on test sets where only the inputs are provided and
the outputs from the model are compared to the withheld target variables
and used to estimate the skill of the model.

Two main types of supervised learning problems:
    1. Classification: involves predicting a class label.
    2. Regression: involves predicting a numerical label.

Both classification and regression problems may have one or more input
variables and input variables may be any data type, such as numerical
or categorical.

Algorithms are referred to as 'supervised' because they learn by making
predictions given examples of input data, and the models are supervised
and corrected via an algorithm to better predict the expected target
outputs in the training dataset.

"The term supervised learning originates from the view of the target
y being provided by an instructor or teacher who shows the machine
learning system what to do". Deep Learning, 2016
