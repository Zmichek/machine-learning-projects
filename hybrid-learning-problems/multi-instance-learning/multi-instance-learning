Multi-instance learning is a supervised learning problem where individual
examples are unlabeled; instead, bags or groups of samples are labeled.

In multi-instance learning, an entire collection of examples is labeled
as containing or not containing an example of a class, but the individual
members of the collection are not labeled.

Instances are in "bags" rather than sets because a given instance may be
present one or more times, e.g. duplicates.

Modeling involves using knowledge that one or some of the instances in a
bag are associated with a target label, and to predict the label for new
bags in the future given their composition of multiple unlabeled examples.
