Self-supervised learning refers to an unsupervised learning problem
that is framed as a supervised learning problem in order to apply
supervised learning algorithms to solve it.

Supervised learning algorithms are used to solve an alternate or pretext
task, the result of which is a model or representation that can be used
in the solution of the original (actual) modeling problem.
