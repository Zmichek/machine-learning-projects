Online learning involves using the data available and updating the model
directly before a prediction is required or after the last observation
was made.

Online learning is appropriate for those problems where observations are
provided over time and where the probability distribution of observations
is expected to also change over time. Therefore, the model is expected to
change just as frequently in order to capture and harness those changes.

Traditionally machine learning is performed offline, which means we have
a batch of data, and we optimize an equation […] However, if we have
streaming data, we need to perform online learning, so we can update
our estimates as each new data point arrives rather than waiting until
“the end” (which may never occur).

This approach is also used by algorithms where there may be more
observations than can reasonably fit into memory, therefore, learning
is performed incrementally over observations, such as a stream of data.
