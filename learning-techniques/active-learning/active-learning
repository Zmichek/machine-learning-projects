Active learning is a technique where the model is able to query a human user
operator during the learning process in order to resolve ambiguity during
the learning process.

Active learning: The learner adaptively or interactively collects training
examples, typically by querying an oracle to request labels for new points.

Active learning is a type of supervised learning and seeks to achieve the
same or better performance of so-called “passive” supervised learning,
although by being more efficient about what data is collected
or used by the model.

The key idea behind active learning is that a machine learning algorithm
can achieve greater accuracy with fewer training labels if it is allowed
to choose the data from which it learns. An active learner may pose
queries, usually in the form of unlabeled data instances to be labeled
by an oracle (e.g. human annotator).

It is not unreasonable to view active learning as an approach to solving
semi-supervised learning problems, or an alternative paradigm for the
same types of problems.

… we see that active learning and semi-supervised learning attack the same
problem from opposite directions. While semi-supervised methods exploit
what the learner thinks it knows about the unlabeled data, active methods
attempt to explore the unknown aspects. It is therefore natural to think
about combining the two.

Active learning is a useful approach when there is not much data available
and new data is expensive to collect or label.

The active learning process allows the sampling of the domain to be
directed in a way that minimizes the number of samples and maximizes
the effectiveness of the model.

Active learning is often used in applications where labels are expensive
to obtain, for example computational biology applications.
