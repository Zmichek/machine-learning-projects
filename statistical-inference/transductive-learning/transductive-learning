Transduction or transductive learning is used in the field of statistical
learning theory to refer to predicting specific examples given specific
examples from a domain.

It is different from induction that involves learning general rules from
specific examples, e.g. specific to specific.

Unlike induction, no generalization is required; instead, specific examples
are used directly. This may, in fact, be a simpler problem than induction
to solve.

The model of estimating the value of a function at a given point of
interest describes a new concept of inference: moving from the particular
to the particular. We call this type of inference transductive inference.
Note that this concept of inference appears when one would like to get the
best result from a restricted amount of information.
