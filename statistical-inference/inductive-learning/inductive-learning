Inductive learning involves using evidence to determine the outcome.

Inductive reasoning refers to using specific cases to determine general
outcomes, e.g. specific to general.

Most ML models learn using a type of inductive inference or inductive
reasoning where general rules (the model) are learned from specific
historical examples (the data).

Fitting a machine learning model is a process of induction. The model
is a generalization of the specific examples in the training dataset.

A model or hypothesis is made about the problem using the training data,
and it is believed to hold over new unseen data later when the model is
used.

Lacking any further information, our assumption is that the best hypothesis
regarding unseen instances is the hypothesis that best fits the observed
training data. This is the fundamental assumption of inductive learning.
