Inference refers to reaching an outcome or decision.

In ML, fitting a model and making a prediction are both types of inference.

There are different paradigms for inference that may be used as a framework
for understanding how some machine learning algorithms work or how some
learning problems may be approached.

Some examples of approaches to learning are inductive, deductive, and
transductive learning and inference.

Contrasting Induction, Deduction, and Transduction:
    . Induction: Learning a general model from specific examples.
    . Deduction: Using a model to make predictions.
    . Transduction: Using specific examples to make predictions.
