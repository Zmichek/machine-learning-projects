Deductive or deductive inference refers to using general rules to
determine specific outcomes.

We can better understand induction by contrasting it with deduction.

Deduction is the reverse of induction. If induction is going from the
specific to the general, deduction is going from the general to
the specific.

Induction is the inverse of deduction.

Deduction is a top-down type of reasoning that seeks for all premises
to be met before determining the conclusion, whereas induction is a
bottom-up type of reasoning that uses available data as evidence for
an outcome.

In the context of machine learning, once we use induction to fit a
model on a training data set, the model can be used to make predictions.
The use of the model is a type of deduction or deductive inference.
