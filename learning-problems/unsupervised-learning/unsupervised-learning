Unsupervised learning describes a class of problems that involves using a
model to describe or extract relationships in data.

Compared to supervised learning, unsupervised learning operates upon only
the input data without outputs or target variables. As such, unsupervised
learning does not have a teacher correcting the model, as in the case of
supervised learning.

In unsupervised learning, there is no instructor or teacher, and the
algorithm must learn to make sense of the data without this guide.

Two main unsupervised learning problems encountered:
  1. Clustering: Involves finding groups in data
  2. Density Estimation: Involves summarizing the distribution of data

Two other types of unsupervised learning problems encountered:
  3. Visualization: Involves creating plots of data
   . An example of a visualization technique would be a scatter plot
     matrix that creates one scatter plot of each pair of variables
     in the data set.
  4. Projection: Involves creating lower-dimensional representations of data
   . An example of a projection method would be Principal component analysis
     that involves summarizing a data set in terms of eigenvalues and
     eigenvectors, with linear dependencies removed.

The goal in such unsupervised learning problems may be to discover groups
of similar examples within the data, where it is called Clustering, or to
determine the distribution of data within the input space, known as Density
Estimation, or to project the data from a high-dimensional space down to two
or three dimensions for the purpose of visualization.

Clustering and density estimation may be performed to learn about the patterns
in the data.
